When a component is unmounted, its lifecycle method componentWillUnmount (for class components) or useEffect cleanup function (for functional components) is called before the component is removed from the UI. Unmounting is a critical phase in the React component lifecycle and is useful for performing cleanup tasks, such as removing event listeners or canceling network requests, to avoid memory leaks and improve performance.",
